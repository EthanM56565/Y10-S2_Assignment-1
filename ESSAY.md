Machine learning is a subset of AI. Machine learning allows computers to learn and adapt from past experiences without humans having to add extra code to the program. 
AI is totally different from any other computer analisis where humans have to write rules for the computer to follow. 
The computer makes its own rules by experiencing and adapting to the situation. 
Machine learning algorithms find patterns and relationships in what it's doing and make decisions or predictions on what to do based on what patterns and relationships it found. 

The start of machine learning starts with data collection. Representative data is essential for training AI accurately. 
This data comes in different forms such as text, images, audio or numerical data. This data oftenly needs to be cleaned up, transformed and organised into a suitable format so that outlines of the data are clear for the AI.
Feature Extraction and selection is the next part of machine learning fundamentals. 
Feature extraction and selection are distinctive attributes of the data that are very important for model learning.
Model learning is a program that can find patterns and make decisions from an unseen dataset. 

Choosing a good machine learning algorithm or model is a crucial step. The choice on what AI you use depends on the problem or situation.
Depending on what data is available and what outcome you want is important to think about when choosing an AI. 
When the model of the AI is chosen the AI is trained on the data using optimization techniques to make sure prediction and outcomes are similar. 

To make sure that the trained Model adapts well to unseen data is crucial for the models performance. 
Testing the Models is generally done by using a variety of tests using validation and testing datasets. 
Using Validation techniques help to access the models reliability stats making sure that the model is doing well in the training process. 
Model evaluation and optimization is assessing the models effectiveness and efficacy in doing a task. 
They test a model's optimization by doing a series of performance tests such as accuracy and presentation tests. This overall improves the model and makes sure that the model is optimised. 

Machine learning techniques 
Supervised learning
In supervised learning the model of the AI learns from a series of labelled data. Where input is associated with the corresponding target labels. 
Common things that supervised learning is used for are image recognition neural networks and various jobs.  

Reinforcement learning 
Reinforcement learning or (RL) is a specific way of teaching AI something through its own experiences by interacting with an environment. 
The AI learns by feedback from the environment in forms of reward or loss. 
An example where this is used is teaching AI certain games where the AI learns how to play the game off winning or losing in different situations.

unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is where the creators of the AI learn for itself without any human input. 
They just let the AI try to find patterns and relationships in the code or game by itself.

Semi supervised learning 
Semi supervised learning AI learning implements both unsupervised and supervised learning into teaching an AI something. 
It uses humans to tell the AI certain algorithms and patterns but the AI also uses unsupervised learning where it has to find patterns and algorithms by itself without a set of code.  

 The Impact that machine learning will have on the future 
Machine learning is already implemented into work industries such as healthcare,transport ,finance, security and entertainment.
Machine learning has allowed jobs that once needed to be run by a human to be human free using AI.
Jobs such as fraud detection are being monitored  by Ai and computer programs. Machine learning is being used in things such as the car industry to make self driving cars and assistive driving modes.
Machine learning's impact on the world will only grow and the ability to use AI will only increase.
